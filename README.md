Overview: Built a comprehensive E-commerce application utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as Redux, Hooks, GraphQL, Stripe, Firebase, and more. This project aims to provide a robust foundation for a scalable, feature-rich online shopping experience.

Features:

1. Implement the core structure of the application using React, ensuring a modular and reusable component-based architecture.
   
2. Utilized React Router to create a smooth and navigable user experience with proper routing for different sections of the application.

3. Integrated Redux for state management, allowing for a centralized and predictable data flow across the application.

4. Leveraged Firebase for backend services, including authentication, real-time database for product information, and hosting for deployment.

5. Integrated the Stripe API for secure and seamless payment processing, allowing users to make purchases with confidence.

6. Styled components using the Styled Components library to enhance maintainability and create a consistent, visually appealing design.

7. Enhanced Redux functionality by incorporating Redux-Saga middleware for handling asynchronous operations, enabling more complex state management scenarios.

8. Implemented React Hooks and the Context API for efficient state management and avoiding prop drilling, ensuring a more readable and concise codebase.

9. Utilized GraphQL to efficiently fetch and manage data from the server, providing a flexible and powerful alternative to traditional REST APIs.

10. Implemented comprehensive testing strategies, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the application's reliability and robustness using Jest.
